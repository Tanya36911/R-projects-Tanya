## Introduction

This is a ridiculous thing I'm writing in Arvinds class.

### My First Piece Of R Code

setting up libraries

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(tidyverse)
library(ggformula)
library(babynames)

```

calling a data set

```{r}
babynames
```

filtering a data set

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name=="Tanya")
```

plotting a data set

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name=="Tanya") %>% 
  gf_line(n~year)
```

lol what a common name.
